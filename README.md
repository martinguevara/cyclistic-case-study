Hi! Watch me build out a marketing strategy from scratch for a company called Cyclistic, a ride-sharing app for bikes. 

This was part 1 of 2 of a capstone project for Google's Data Analysis program on Coursera where I learned about the average journey of data--from finding the right problems all the way to presenting it.

Throughout the course, I learned about tools like SQL, RStudio, Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel, and Tableau, but it was during this project where most that learning kicked in because I got to use them all.

To read all about it, this is the order I recommend for going through the files:

1. **Cyclistic Case Study Brief:** this is the primer to the entire project where you can find an outline of the problem, its stakeholders, the data sources, and my role in all this
2. **Cyclistic RStudio Data Analysis Journal:** this was a documentation of all the data work I did on RStudio, from cleaning & preparing the data to analyzing it.
3. **Cyclistic Case Study Presentation:** the "coup de grace" aka final piece to the project: the presentation! this was where I synthesized the analysis with my recommendations in one neat slideshow.
If you had to look at _**one thing**__, I would look at this.

I'd appreciate any feedback, and hope you enjoy as much as I did!
